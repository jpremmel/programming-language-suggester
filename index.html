        <h3 class="language">JavaScript!</h3>
        <h4>Anyone interested in front-end design work should learn HTML and CSS - and after learning those, JavaScript is the logical next step for taking your webpages from being static to interactive. Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a full programming language. It is used to fuel a website's behavior. JavaScript has become increasingly popular, and it now lives outside web browsers as well. Learning JavaScript will put you in a good place as it becomes a more general-purpose language.</h4>

        <h4>Python is a general-purpose language used for everything from server automation to data science. Python is a great language for beginners, because it is easy to read and understand. You can also do so many things with Python that it’s easy to stick with the language for quite a while before needing something else. Python finds itself at home both creating Web apps like Instagram and helping researchers make sense of their data.</h4>
